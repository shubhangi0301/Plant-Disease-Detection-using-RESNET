# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-RESNET


This project employs ResNet9 and deep learning to achieve 99.3% accuracy in detecting plant diseases, outperforming InceptionV3 and GoogleNet. Leveraging 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased plant leaves across various species, including grapes and tomatoes, the model effectively identifies diseases like grape esca and tomato late blight. Through image analysis techniques like enhancement and noise reduction, ResNet9 demonstrates superior feature extraction capabilities.
